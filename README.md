# Sudoku Solver

## Overview
This is a simple web-based Sudoku solver that visually solves a given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It was entirely generated within like **5 minutes** using ChatGPT, including both the idea and the implementation.

## Features
- Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid
- Automatic validation of input (only allows digits 1-9)
- Backtracking-based Sudoku solver with visual updates
- Option to enable or disable animations for faster solving
- Clear button to reset the board

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser or [open github pages](https://hartmannlight.github.io/sudoku-solver-by-gpt/).
2. Enter the Sudoku puzzle by filling in the numbers (leave blank spaces for unknown cells).
3. Click the **Solve** button to find the solution.
4. Click **Clear** to reset the board.
5. Toggle the **Enable Animations** checkbox:
   - **Enabled**: Visual updates for each step (can be slow)
   - **Disabled**: Instantly fills in the solution

## How It Works
The solver uses a **recursive backtracking algorithm**:
- It finds an empty cell.
- It tries placing numbers 1-9 and checks if they are valid.
- If valid, it moves to the next empty cell and repeats the process.
- If it gets stuck, it backtracks and tries another number.
- The process continues until a solution is found or no valid solution exists.

## Disabling Animations
The solver includes animations that highlight the solving process, but this can slow down performance. To disable animations:
1. Uncheck the "Enable Animations" checkbox before clicking "Solve".
2. This will make the solver instantly fill in the grid without delay.

## Important Notes
- **This entire project (including code and problem statement) was generated by ChatGPT.**
- If no solution exists, a message will indicate that the puzzle is unsolvable.
